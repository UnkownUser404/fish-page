        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            Cods are a type of fish belonging to the Gadidae family, most commonly referring to the Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus). These cold-water fish are known for their firm, white flesh and mild flavor, making them popular in global cuisines, especially in dishes like fish and chips.

            Cods are typically found in deep, cold ocean waters and are bottom-dwellers, often feeding on smaller fish, crustaceans, and invertebrates. They can grow quite large—Atlantic cod, for example, can reach lengths of over 1.5 meters (5 feet) and weigh over 90 kg (200 pounds), though most caught commercially are much smaller.

            Beyond their culinary value, cods have historically been a vital part of the fishing industry in regions like the North Atlantic, particularly around Newfoundland and the North Sea. However, overfishing in the late 20th century led to severe population declines, prompting conservation efforts and tighter regulations in many areas.

        <h2>Behavior</h2>

        <p>
            Cod behavior is shaped by their environment, diet, and social habits, particularly in cold, deep ocean waters where they are most commonly found. Cod are generally demersal fish, meaning they live and feed near the seafloor, although they can also be found in midwater when following prey.

            They are opportunistic feeders, eating a wide variety of food such as smaller fish (like herring and sand eels), crustaceans, squid, and worms. Cod often hunt by slowly cruising the seafloor, using their sensitive lateral line system to detect vibrations and movement in the water.

            Socially, cod can be solitary or form schools, especially during migration or spawning. In colder months or during spawning seasons, they gather in large groups to migrate to specific breeding grounds. Their spawning behavior involves males establishing dominance and attracting females through a combination of color changes, body movements, and sounds generated by muscle contractions.

            Cod are also known for their territorial behavior, especially in older, larger individuals who may remain in specific areas for long periods. However, young cod tend to be more migratory, traveling long distances as they grow and seek food.
