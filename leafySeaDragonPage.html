        <h1>Welcome to the Leafy Sea Dragon page!</h1>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <hr noshade>       
        <p>
            The leafy sea dragon (Phycodurus eques) is a mesmerizing marine creature found along the southern and western coasts of Australia. Known for its elaborate, leaf-like appendages that resemble floating seaweed, the leafy sea dragon is a master of camouflage. These leaf-like extensions aren't used for swimming—they serve purely for disguise, allowing the sea dragon to blend seamlessly into its kelp and seagrass surroundings.

            A relative of the seahorse, the leafy sea dragon can grow up to 35 centimeters (about 14 inches) in length. It moves gracefully through the water using small, almost invisible fins on its neck and tail, giving it the illusion of drifting with the current. Its coloration ranges from green to yellow or brown, often with delicate white or blue markings.

            Leafy sea dragons are slow-moving and rely on stealth to avoid predators. They feed mainly on small crustaceans and plankton, using their long, pipe-like snouts to suck up prey. Like seahorses, it’s the males who carry the eggs, which are transferred to a brood patch under their tail by the female.

            Due to habitat loss and their vulnerability to pollution and human activity, leafy sea dragons are protected under Australian law and are a symbol of marine conservation in the region. Their beauty and uniqueness have made them iconic among ocean lovers and researchers alike.

        <h2>Behavior</h2>
        <hr noshade>      
        <p>
            Leafy sea dragons are known for their calm, slow-moving, and highly secretive behavior. Rather than darting or swimming quickly like many fish, they gently drift through the water, relying on their leaf-like appendages and subtle fin movements to mimic floating seaweed. This stealthy movement helps them avoid predators and remain nearly invisible in their natural habitat of kelp forests and seagrass beds.

            They are solitary creatures, usually found alone or occasionally in loose groups, and they tend to stay within small, familiar territories. Leafy sea dragons are not aggressive and have no known territorial disputes. Instead, they spend most of their time foraging for food—small shrimp, plankton, and other tiny crustaceans—using their long snouts to suck prey in with quick, vacuum-like motions.

            Interestingly, despite their delicate appearance, leafy sea dragons are surprisingly resilient in their native waters. They are crepuscular feeders, meaning they’re most active during dawn and dusk, when light levels help them stay hidden from predators while they search for food.

            One of the most fascinating behaviors is their reproductive process: the female deposits eggs onto the underside of the male’s tail, where he fertilizes and carries them for several weeks until they hatch. During this time, the male protects and oxygenates the eggs by gently waving his tail in the water.
