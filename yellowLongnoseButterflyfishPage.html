        <h2>Description</h2>
        <hr noshade>       
        <p>
            The Yellow Longnose Butterflyfish is a striking and easily recognizable tropical marine fish known for its vibrant colors and distinctive snout. Native to the Indo-Pacific region, this species thrives in coral reef habitats where it glides gracefully among the corals and rocky crevices.

            This butterflyfish features a bright yellow body, which contrasts beautifully with its black triangular mask that covers the eye and extends to the top of its head. Its most defining feature is its elongated, slender snout, used to probe into narrow crevices to feed on small invertebrates, coral polyps, and crustaceans. The snout gives the fish a somewhat comical yet elegant appearance, adding to its popularity in the aquarium trade.

            Typically growing to about 8–9 inches (20–23 cm) in length, the Yellow Longnose Butterflyfish is a peaceful species that is usually seen alone or in pairs. Its unique appearance and relatively hardy nature make it a favorite among marine aquarists, although it requires a well-established tank with plenty of hiding spots and live rock.

            In the wild, this species plays an important role in the reef ecosystem by helping control small invertebrate populations. Its vibrant coloration and graceful swimming style also make it a visual highlight in any reef environment.

        <h2>Behavior</h2>
        <hr noshade>      
        <p>
            The Yellow Longnose Butterflyfish is known for its calm, curious, and somewhat shy nature. It tends to move gracefully through reef environments, often weaving in and out of coral formations with smooth, deliberate movements. This species is diurnal, meaning it’s active during the day and rests at night, typically finding shelter in crevices or under ledges to sleep.

            One of its most distinctive behavioral traits is how it uses its long, narrow snout to forage for food. The fish delicately probes into cracks and coral branches to extract tiny crustaceans, worms, and other small invertebrates that most fish can’t reach. This specialized feeding behavior makes it a highly adapted reef dweller.

            In the wild, Yellow Longnose Butterflyfish are usually seen alone or in bonded pairs, especially during mating seasons. These pairs often stay together over time, exhibiting strong territorial behavior to protect their chosen area of the reef. Despite their peaceful temperament, they can be mildly aggressive toward members of their own species or other butterflyfish if space is limited or if they feel their territory is being invaded.

            In captivity, they tend to adapt well if provided with plenty of hiding spots and room to explore. However, they can be shy at first and may take time to settle in, especially in the presence of more aggressive tankmates.

            Overall, the Yellow Longnose Butterflyfish is a graceful, methodical, and slightly introverted reef dweller whose behavior reflects its natural adaptations to a complex and competitive coral environment.
