        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            The sunfish, or Mola mola, is one of the heaviest bony fish in the world, known for its distinctive, flattened, disk-like body and truncated tail. Native to temperate and tropical oceans worldwide, sunfish can grow up to 3 meters (10 feet) in length and weigh over 2,000 kilograms (4,400 pounds). Despite their massive size and odd shape, they are gentle giants that pose no threat to humans.

            Sunfish are often seen basking near the ocean surface, which is how they got their name—they appear to be "sunbathing." This behavior is thought to help them regulate body temperature after deep dives in colder waters. They feed primarily on jellyfish, but their diet can also include small fish, zooplankton, and algae.

            Their unusual swimming style involves a slow, flapping motion of their tall dorsal and anal fins, since their bodies lack a proper tail for propulsion. Although awkward-looking, they can dive to great depths and travel long distances. Sunfish are solitary or sometimes swim in pairs, and they are known to host large numbers of parasites, often prompting them to visit "cleaning stations" where smaller fish and even birds help remove the parasites.

        <h2>Behavior</h2>
        <hr noshade>      
        <p>
            Sunfish behavior is characterized by a mix of deep-diving foraging patterns, surface basking, and slow, drifting movement. These ocean giants are generally solitary but occasionally travel in pairs or small groups. Despite their sluggish appearance, sunfish are capable of deep dives—often reaching depths of over 600 meters (about 2,000 feet)—in search of gelatinous prey like jellyfish, which make up a large part of their diet.

            One of their most distinctive behaviors is "sunbathing" at the surface. After deep, cold-water dives, sunfish often float on their sides near the surface, likely to absorb heat from the sun and regulate their body temperature. This basking behavior also makes them vulnerable to boat strikes, as they can be mistaken for debris or remain motionless in shipping lanes.

            Sunfish are also known for frequenting "cleaning stations," where smaller fish or seabirds feed on the parasites that cover their skin and even enter their gill chambers and mouths. This symbiotic behavior helps reduce parasite loads, which are often extreme in sunfish due to their slow movements and large surface area.

            Though sunfish are not aggressive, they are curious and sometimes approach divers or boats. Their behavior is still not fully understood, but ongoing studies using tagging and satellite tracking have shed light on their complex migration patterns and vertical movement through the water column.
