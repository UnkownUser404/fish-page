        <h2>Description</h2>

            Lobsters are marine crustaceans known for their strong claws, segmented bodies, and tough exoskeletons. Found mainly in cold, rocky waters like those of the Atlantic Ocean, they play an important role in marine ecosystems and coastal economies. With one large claw for crushing and a smaller one for cutting, lobsters use their tools to hunt and defend themselves. They are omnivores, feeding on fish, mollusks, algae, and even dead animals.

            Lobsters grow by molting, shedding their shells and forming new, larger ones. This process continues throughout their lives, which can span several decades. Unlike many animals, lobsters don’t show clear signs of aging, though they aren’t truly immortal — eventually, molting becomes too difficult and leads to their death.

            Once considered low-class food, lobster is now a luxury item, especially in North American cuisine. However, overfishing and climate change pose threats to their populations. Conservation and sustainable fishing practices are essential to protect these fascinating creatures for the future.

        <h2>Behavior</h2>

        <p>
            Lobsters are mostly solitary, bottom-dwelling creatures that prefer to live in crevices or burrows in rocky, coastal environments. They're generally nocturnal, meaning they’re most active during the night. During the day, they stay hidden to avoid predators.

            One of the most notable aspects of lobster behavior is their territorial nature. Males, in particular, can be aggressive and often fight to defend their shelters. These fights are mostly ritualistic and involve displays of strength using their claws—especially the larger "crusher" claw. Once dominance is established, the winner gets to keep the shelter, while the loser retreats.

            Lobsters communicate through a combination of body movements and chemical signals. They have poor eyesight, so they rely heavily on their antennae and chemical receptors to navigate and interact with their environment.

            Molting is another key behavioral trait. Since their hard shells don’t grow with them, lobsters periodically shed their exoskeletons in a process called molting. This is a vulnerable time, as they’re soft and exposed to predators until the new shell hardens. Interestingly, lobsters can regrow lost limbs during molting cycles.

            Feeding-wise, lobsters are omnivorous scavengers. They'll eat live prey like clams, worms, or small fish but won’t hesitate to munch on decaying matter as well. Their diet helps maintain the health of their ecosystems by cleaning up the seafloor.

            Social behaviors also come into play during mating. After a dominant male secures a shelter, females will seek him out to mate. But first, a female must molt—since mating only happens when her shell is soft. She'll live in the male’s den for a short period, mate, and then leave to harden her shell and eventually lay eggs.

            All in all, lobsters lead fascinating, complex lives beneath the surface, balancing fierce independence with just enough social interaction to keep their species thriving.
